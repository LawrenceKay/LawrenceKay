 *Computational social science for better public policy*
 
I lead teams in the delivery of complex analytical, computational, and public policy projects. To do so I combine data science, economics, and leadership skills, practised through policy-making across the United Kingdom and in developing countries.

I’m driven by the opportunities we now have to combine machine learning with multi-disciplinary thinking to improve public decision-making for all of us. And I’m taking advantage of those opportunities with a full-stack of capabilities in SQL, Python, statistical modelling, innovation management, and clear communication.
